Acknowledge their problems, take steps to alleviate them, and reward them for their continued loyalty.
   
2) Comparative and competitive analysis53% of high-value customers left due to superior products or services provided by competitors. To better position itself in the market, the company should conduct a competitive analysis and benc nark its products and services against those of its competitors. By doing so, the company can anticipate a decrease in churn, which will improve customer retention.
   
3) San Diego marketing offers San Diego is responsible for 23% of total revenue lost to high-value customers. The company can improve customer retention by implementing marketing campaigns an promoting Offer A, which had the lowest overall churn rate of 6.7%.
